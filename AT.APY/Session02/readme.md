### Exercise 02

![](https://github.com/dadandroid/MPDA20/blob/master/AT.APY/Session02/assignment02/MPDA20_assignment2.jpg)


Template file:
[MPDA20_AT-APY-01-kmeans.gh](https://github.com/dadandroid/MPDA20/blob/master/AT.APY/Session02/assignment02/MPDA20_AT-APY-02-kmeans-assignment02.gh) 


The excercise has two goals:

1. Deconstruct a geometry that you want to analyze into smaller, similar pieces (1): In class we deconcunstructed a mesh into  mesh faces in order to cluster them. You have to come up with a different geometry that you want to analyze, anything that you can deconstruct into smaller parts, it can be a mesh, a brep, a set of curves, it's up to you.

2. Create a python component (2) that takes a list of geometries as an input and gives a list of n-dimensional vectors as an output (see template file as example). You must come up with a logic to analyze and cluster the geometries, deconsctructing them further into number parameters that will be the dimensiones of your vector (like in the class exercise)


- Given the vast amount of possibilities to do this exercise, there should be **no two similar starting geometries nor ways to deconstruct them**

- You must submit your .gh file to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y9mrKY5IfePMbXZwbmfIuZeWHrg3FYfY?usp=sharing) **no later Monday 4th of May** with format __MPDA20-ATAPY-EX02-Your_Name.gh__ 

- Please do this exercise individually! (We can always tell when thatÂ´s not the case). We will review some of the excersies in the next class

- Let us know if you have any doubts!
